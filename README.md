# Image Enhancement for Extreme Weather Conditions

This capstone project aims to develop efficient models that can apply image enhancements on photos affected by extreme weather and phenomena in underwater, foggy, and hazy conditions.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow
- Google Colab
- QEMU (used as an emulation environment for Raspberry Pi testing)

## About the Project

Extreme weather conditions such as fog, haze, and underwater environments can significantly degrade the quality of photos. This project aims to develop efficient models that can enhance these photos and improve their visual quality.

We use TensorFlow and Google Colab to develop and train our models. Our goal is to create models that can effectively enhance photos in a variety of challenging weather conditions.

We hope that our project will improve the ability to capture and share high-quality photos in extreme weather conditions.

## To-Do

- Refactor the code
- Make the model run on Raspberry Pi
- Deploy the model in a React web app

## Future Potential

In the future, we aim to continue improving our image enhancement models and making them more widely available. This will allow more users to easily access and use our models to improve their photos.
